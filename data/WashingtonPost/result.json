It was the first successful attempt to set up a “humanitarian corridor” out of the city, which at one time was home to as many as 400,000 people. But much needed aid was blocked Monday from getting in by Russian forces, Ukrainian officials said.\n\n",

Locals said there were roughly 128 apartments in the building and that about half the occupants had fled before Tuesday’s attack.\n\n",

I never thought putting on pajamas would make me cry with happiness.”\n\nUnlike the millions who have fled to western Ukrainian cities, where nights are still interrupted by hours of air raid sirens, and where the crush of new people is a constant reminder of the merciless destruction they left behind, those who have fled to the Carpathians described a more genuine sense of being protected.\n\n",

Ukraine had a few before the invasion and has pleaded for more as Russian forces have intensified their bombardment of key cities.\n\nAsked if the U.S. was prepared to send Slovakia replacements, such as Patriot missiles, Austin demurred. “These are things we will continue to work with all of our allies on and, certainly, this is not just a U.S. issue.

    "ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — Traumatized residents from Mariupol, Ukraine, arrived in a nonstop stream of cars at a humanitarian aid station on Friday, describing urban fighting and devastation as Ukrainian forces appeared to lose their grip on parts of the battered city.\n\nThey arrived in a near-constant convoy in the city of Zaporizhzhia, 140 miles to the northwest, their vehicles marked with white flags and signs reading “children” in the hope that it would spare them from attack.\n\nSome families drove cars with their windshields smashed out or shattered from the force of explosions near their homes. One car, struck in a rocket attack, looked as if it had defied the odds by being able to move at all, one side completely punched in by the impact.\n\nBut with vehicles the only way out, anything that could move was put to use. Some cars were crammed with eight or nine people.\n\n",

    "The mounting death toll in Ukraine has forced President Zelensky to consider concessions to Russia in order to bring an end to the devastating conflict, but the specific elements of any peace deal his government may be discussing with Moscow remain a mystery to Western leaders, said U.S. and European officials.\n\nThe secretive rounds of meetings between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators could hold the key to ending the conflict but also carry broader implications for European security depending on how the warring parties settle their differences. If Putin can use military force to compel political change in Ukraine, he could use the same tactic elsewhere, officials fear.\n\nThe prospects of a near-term deal look bleak, diplomats say, but mixed signals from Zelensky about how close he is to striking an agreement have only heightened anxiety about the trajectory of the negotiations.\n\n",

    "Russian shelling and siege tactics have devastated Mariupol’s residential neighborhoods, drone video published Wednesday by Ukraine’s far-right Azov Battalion revealed. The video was verified by The Washington Post.\n\nThe majority of the structures visible sustained some amount of damage, from blown-out windows to entire multistory buildings burned ashen gray. Smoke rose from at least four areas in the minute-long clip.\n\nAmid a communication blackout, the Azov Battalion has been one of the few sources of videos and information coming out of the city that has served as its primary base for years. \n\nThe paramilitary group with ties to extremists across Europe has been fighting for Ukraine since 2014, when it was absorbed into Ukraine’s national guard. Its presence has been used by Russian President Vladimir Putin to falsely claim that the Ukrainian government is run by neo-Nazis. \n\n",

    "- President Biden, in Warsaw on the final leg of his European trip, will spend Saturday focusing on the humanitarian crisis triggered by the Russian invasion. After talks with his Polish counterpart, Biden will meet with the mayor of Warsaw — who has warned that the capital is struggling to cope with the refugee influx — as well as displaced Ukrainians.\n\n- The Pentagon said Russia has halted ground operations toward Kyiv and is instead focusing attacks on the eastern Donbas region. The move has been seen as a sign Moscow might be paring back its ambitions for the invasion, but air attacks continue. \n\n- A senior U.S. defense official confirmed that Ukraine has destroyed a Russian landing ship docked in the occupied port city Russia has been using for resupplies. Ukraine's president lauded the attack and also mockingly speculated about the whereabouts of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who has only briefly been seen in public in the past month.\n\n",

Continued revenue from foreign oil and gas sales — despite Western sanctions — also is helping him ease the blow of harsh economic sanctions at home.\n\nBut the Russian president does face certain tactical strictures on the battlefield, as well as some geopolitical and economic constraints. They all will probably make his ability to wage a longer-term war in Ukraine more difficult — but far from impossible.\n\n",

Each night, Russian troops would barge in, telling the group of about 20 people to quickly line up for a head count. “ ‘If somebody is missing, we’ll kill everybody else,’ ” Vasil Hilko recalled them saying.\n\nOne night, a commander gave them just 10 seconds to line up “ ‘before we start shooting,’ ” he said.

The chancellor voiced his displeasure with the experts in an interview with the broadcaster ARD, saying it was “irresponsible to add up mathematical models that then don’t work.”\n\n“They get it wrong!” he exclaimed.\n\nThe standoff is at the heart of an intensifying debate in Germany over how quickly it can wean itself off Russian oil and gas, and what sacrifices the government should ask of the public.\n\n",

    "- Russia pledged during Tuesday’s peace talks that it would “drastically reduce” attacks near two Ukrainian cities, but Ukrainian military leaders said Russia was probably using the maneuvers to “mislead” and merely rotate its troops.\n\n- Ukrainian assertions that it was pushing back Russian forces near Kyiv — where Moscow said it would scale back its assault — generally appear to be true, according to a Post reporter on the ground. But heavy shelling continues elsewhere, and new satellite images of the bombed-out southern port city of Mariupol document severe damage to civilian infrastructure. The photos depict long lines outside a grocery store in the city, where local leaders have warned of a severe shortage of basic necessities.\n\n- Evacuations from Mariupol resumed Tuesday, one day after security concerns halted them across the country. More than 1,600 people escaped Mariupol and a nearby region, officials said. \n\n",

    "\nMore than 4 million people have fled Ukraine, the United Nations said Wednesday — meaning that nearly 10 percent of the prewar population has poured out of the country in about five weeks.\n\nThe exodus, staggering in its scale and speed, has turned into the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. The conflict has forced about 1 in 4 people out of their homes, seeking refuge within the country or across its borders. It has also uprooted half of Ukraine’s children, raising fears of the threat of human trafficking, The Washington Post reported this month.\n\nInside the country, fighting has displaced at least 6.5 million people since Russian tanks rolled in on Feb. 24, according to the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR. Millions more are stranded “or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information,” it said earlier.\n\n",

It works by distorting shapes and reducing heat signatures, in effect fooling the eye to create doubt and confusion.\n\nYet to some observers who’ve closely tracked the conflict in Ukraine, Russian forces, despite their military superiority, have exhibited a breathtaking degree of amateurism. \n\n",

    "Even amid the barbarity of Russia’s month-long assault on Ukraine, nowhere has suffered such a cruel fate as Mariupol, the coastal port city that President Vladimir Putin appears set on capturing at any cost.\n\nOnce a thriving community on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol is now described by the local city council as “the ashes of a dead land.\" It reports 5,000 have been killed, although such figures are impossible to verify. After a brutal three-week siege, the battle moved into the city streets, where Ukrainian forces now fight house-to-house with Russian and separatist forces present in every neighborhood.\n\nWith communications from the city blocked, those who escape bring with them stories of hunger, fear and survival. Some tremble with emotion as they arrive to safety in Zaporizhzhia, 140 miles to the northwest. \n\nThe Washington Post interviewed more than 50 people who escaped the horrors of the city. \n\n",

    "Russia’s apparent retreat from Kyiv and retrenchment into Ukraine’s easternmost regions marks the latest sign that the war is at an inflection point — one that U.S. officials believe could portend even uglier fighting to come.\n\n“The next stage of this conflict may very well be protracted,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Monday.\n\nThe ferocious resistance has claimed Russian materiel, momentum and troops’ lives in quantities that far exceeded expectations — forcing Moscow to scramble so much that now its armed forces have largely sapped readily available reinforcements in Ukraine, according to military analysts. That leaves Russian commanders in the short term to fight with the resources at their disposal. U.S. officials believe that about two-thirds of the units that had been focused on Kyiv are heading north, back to Belarus and Russia, for expected repositioning in Donbas.\n\n",

So, in late March, prosecutors began going to displaced people rather than waiting for them to reach out.\n\n“I thought the judicial system was lagging before this invasion,” school director Halyna Hrymaliuk told The Washington Post. “I work at a state-owned school, so when I heard prosecutors were coming here, to be frank, I didn’t believe this.”\n\nShe decided to quietly sit in on interviews, hoping to understand the prosecutors’ goals. They worked from early morning until late at night, she said. \n\nThey were far more efficient than Hrymaliuk had expected. “I was impressed,” she said.\n\n",

    "Inside a warehouse, in a bustling section of this capital, the incessant cracking sound of gunfire echoed off walls. Men in olive-colored camouflage were training for war. Most wore helmets and bulletproof jackets. Some wore high-top sneakers. All clutched AK-47 rifles and waited for their turn to shoot at a round target 50 yards away.\n\nIt was centered with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s face — and peppered with bullet holes.\n\nInvisible, yet palpable, was the shadow cast over this new regiment, like every unit of the Azov Battalion. Alexi Suliyma knew about its ugly past, but he joined anyway. Two friends were in the force, and he felt the Azov would best train him to defend his motherland.\n\n“These are guys who simply love their country and Ukrainian people,” said Suliyma, 23, a former construction worker. “I never knew them to be Nazis or fascists, never heard them make calls for the Third Reich.”\n\n",

    "The city of Mykolaiv has been defended fiercely by Ukrainian forces blocking Russia’s attempts to advance toward the strategically key Black Sea port of Odessa, about 70 miles to the southwest. When Russian forces couldn’t go through Mykolaiv last month, they tried to go around it, storming into an area of small, rural towns north of the city.\n\nRussians arrived in columns of armored vehicles and occupied these hamlets for about 10 days before Ukrainian military forces ejected them. In interviews with The Post in recent days, residents recounted how they were terrorized by their new Russian overlords. Their stories offer a glimpse of abuse and violence against unarmed civilians that could be used as evidence in potential war crimes cases against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military. \n\nSimilar stories have been emerging in recent days from areas around Kyiv that were under Russian control until recently.\n\n",

Pirmann opened her website scraping tool, backing up the site and preserving its content.\n\nNow, the original website is lost, its server space likely gone to cyberattacks, power outages or Russian shelling.

Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted last week are more skilled at fighting in rural terrain.\n\n- Russia has appointed Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, who commanded Russian forces in Syria, to oversee its war on Ukraine, a senior U.S. official confirmed. His appointment marks the first time a single commander has taken control of the operation in Ukraine.\n\n- On the heels of visits by European leaders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the international community to push harder against Moscow, specifically in refusing to buy Russian oil — something the United States has done but Europe has resisted.\n\n",

    "\nMore than six weeks into his war against Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin is feeling the sting of failure.\n\nThousands of Russian battlefield deaths. Three front-line retreats by the Russian military. Millions of Ukrainians who will never forgive Moscow. More isolation than ever — and very few goals achieved.\n\nPutin is now regrouping to focus his military campaign on Ukraine’s east in what is widely seen as “Plan B,” after his forces failed to topple Ukraine’s government or wrest control of its biggest cities. All the while, questions are mounting about how a Russian leader steeped in security policy and known for railing against the folly of regime-change wars could have sleepwalked into a such a strategic mess.\n\nAt issue is a broader question that will occupy historians for years: How could Russia — a country with such deep familial, cultural and historic ties to its western neighbor — get Ukraine so wrong?\n\n",

    "MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — At the moment the rockets began to slam into the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in the early morning hours six weeks ago, Lidiia Kalashnykova was jolted from her sleep and made her decision: from then on, she would speak only Ukrainian.\n\n“As strange as it may sound, it was that very instant, and all that stress served to make me reject the Russian language — completely,” Kalashnykova said.\n\nLike most Ukrainians, Kalashnykova functions equally well in both languages. In her everyday life, though, and with her husband and two small children, she largely spoke Russian. She was raised in a Russian-speaking family and estimated that 90 percent of her relatives speak Russian.\n\nBut when Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, she said she “realized in a second” that she had “no right to use any language other than Ukrainian” and that “the Ukrainian language is actually my weapon.”\n\n",

When he is on-call, which is pretty much always these days, he cannot be more than a bathroom break away from his cockpit. When a cruise missile or a Russian fighter is spotted moving toward the area Juice is assigned to by the Ukrainian air force, he doesn’t even have time to run through standard safety checks before taking off.\n\n“We’re ready to be killed,” said Juice, who provided only his call sign for security reasons.\n\n“But we don’t want this, of course,” the 29-year-old added. “We want to kill Russians and take down their bombers that are killing our cities and our families.”\n\nJuice is one of the pilots helping Ukraine pull off the biggest surprise of this war: Its military has kept the airspace over Ukraine contested despite Russia’s more advanced jets and superior numbers. \n\n",

Hours later, the Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged that a key ship in its Black Sea fleet had suffered significant damage but didn’t address Ukrainian claims.\n\nInstead, the Russians said they would investigate what happened and said a fire had detonated the ship’s ammunition.

Putin was labeled a war criminal, and several Western leaders have accused Russia of carrying out a “genocide.”\n\nThe fallout from Putin’s invasion also has repercussions far beyond Ukraine.

    "Last month, as many tech companies sided with Ukraine over Russia’s invasion, TikTok appeared to follow suit by suspending new video uploads and live streams from Russia. The company said it made the move to protect Russian users from the country’s new laws criminalizing criticism of its military.\n\nBut the wildly popular, Chinese-owned social media app also walled off Russian users from seeing any posts at all from outside the country, including from Ukraine — effectively creating a second, censored version of its platform. For the tens of millions of Russians on TikTok, the outside world has fallen silent.\n\nTikTok’s block on outside content appears to have effectively purged the app of non-Russian content. But its block on Russian content has proved porous, letting pro-government propaganda slip through. \n\n",

Shops and cafes in the usually bustling city center closed as locals headed to underground shelters. News that the deadly strikes had hit near the city’s landmark train depot, the first stop for many families fleeing violence elsewhere, was interpreted as a clear message: Nowhere in Ukraine is safe from Russian attack.\n\nSeven people were killed and 11 injured, including a child, Ukrainian officials said Monday, amid renewed attacks in northern and western Ukraine over the weekend.\n\nLviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said Monday on social media that five missiles had struck the city, while Lviv’s regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, reported four missile strikes, with three hitting military infrastructure and one a tire-fitting facility.\n\n",

She combed her walled courtyard for them, she said, after a Russian artillery shell carrying them burst somewhere overhead days before the Russians withdrew late last month, seeding the area with thousands of potentially lethal darts. Some were embedded in the tarp that covered her vehicle, as if someone nailed them to her car.\n\n“If you look closely on the ground around my house, you will find a lot more of them,” said Chmut, 54.\n\nThese projectiles, called fléchettes, are rarely seen or used in modern conflict, experts have said. \n\n",

Instead, the plant and its network of underground tunnels are serving as a shelter and final holdout for thousands of Ukrainian fighters, including many from the Azov Battalion, one of Ukraine’s most skilled — and controversial — military units.\n\nAs many as 1,000 civilians are also hiding in the subterranean network, Mariupol’s city council said in a Telegram message Monday.\n\n",

    "RIGA, Latvia — The sinking of the Russian warship Moskva is causing tension back home, where some families are reporting sailors dead or missing despite a Defense Ministry claim that the whole crew had been evacuated.\n\nThe flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet sank last week after being hit by two Ukrainian missiles, delivering a significant blow to the Russian naval capacity, U.S. and Ukrainian officials said.\n\nRussia confirmed that the ship sank but said only that it had been damaged by “heavy storms” and a fire that caused ammunition on board to detonate. On April 14, the Russian Defense Ministry said all crew members were evacuated. The authorities have not confirmed any dead or wounded.\n\n",

    "Russian forces committed multiple apparent war crimes while occupying the Ukrainian town of Bucha in March, New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday.\n\nThe report adds to the evidence documenting alleged atrocities by Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nThe rights group’s researchers spent a week interviewing residents in Bucha, a suburb of the capital, Kyiv, earlier this month. They found evidence of summary executions, torture and enforced disappearances by Russian forces, “all of which would constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity,” the group said.\n\nThe Geneva Conventions governing the laws of war forbid indiscriminate killings, enforced disappearances and torture, as well as the humiliating or inhumane treatment of prisoners of war.\n\n",

Moldova summoned Russia’s ambassador later Friday to express “deep concern” over Minnekaev’s comments.\n\nAnalysts say it’s unlikely that the Russian military, embroiled in a fight to take eastern Ukraine, is capable of carving out such a path.

    "\nAt the start of the invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin appeared confident that the capital, Kyiv, would fall without a fight, cowed by the speed and strength of Russia’s advance.\n\nBut almost immediately, Russian forces stalled outside the city, hobbled by poor planning and critical supply shortages. Russia’s delay allowed Kyiv to build up its defenses and prepare for an urban battle — one that Moscow wasn’t prepared to fight.\n\nWhy? Urban areas are a three-dimensional terrain in which attackers must consider a 360-degree sphere of potential threat. Defenders have an advantage, but they must worry about limiting harm to civilians and the city itself.\n\nBuildings provide high angles from which to shoot as well as cover from observation and attacks.\n\nUnderground spaces, such as maintenance tunnels and subways, offer areas to depot supplies, protect from aerial attacks and conceal movement from the enemy.\n\n",

They drew swift condemnation from Moldova, where residents have worried since the beginning of the war they could be next in the Kremlin’s crosshairs.\n\nMinnekayev said capturing Ukraine’s east and south would create a “land corridor” to the Crimean Peninsula — which the Kremlin annexed in 2014 — and give Moscow influence over “vital objects of the Ukrainian economy,” according to the Russia state media.\n\n",

Cherepanov, 45, wanted to use his skills to help people find information about their missing loved ones, he said this week via Telegram.\n\n",

Maybe in past years, they would have exchanged recipes for their traditional holiday cakes. This Sunday, they traded horror stories about their time under Russian occupation.\n\nThe Bucha residents were standing outside a white, gold-domed church. The grounds had become the site of a mass grave of their neighbors.\n\n“I come here every year for Easter, but especially this year. Because I lived. They were shooting at me,” said Tatiana. She then started crying, unable to say more.\n\nThis Orthodox Easter — typically a colorful occasion with frosted cakes and painted eggs — was a somber but defiant one in Ukraine. It marked the 60th day of a bloody war.\n\n",

It was unclear what triggered the decision, which a company spokesperson told Chinese media was “not a statement targeting any particular country but rather a statement about our principles.”\n\nRussia’s assault on Ukraine has increased scrutiny on DJI over fears that Beijing’s close geopolitical partnership with Moscow might hamper the company’s efforts to prevent its products from being used by the Russian army.\n\n",

The Russians are not in custody, and the charges were filed in absentia to Ukrainian courts.\n\nThis decision signals Kyiv’s resolve to hold Moscow accountable and its determination to ensure that the voices of the victims and their families are heard, said Mervyn Cheong, a law professor at the National University of Singapore who also serves as counsel before the International Criminal Court.\n\n",

But apparent Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil in the past week highlight how the conflict has spilled across the border, unsettling residents of regions near the border and threatening to upend President Vladimir Putin’s effort to insulate his citizens from the fighting he started.\n\nIn the wake of the shellings and strikes, local authorities are sounding alarms — as well as calling for revenge and in some cases evacuations — as they contend with the growing peril.\n\nThe attacks, which Ukrainian leaders have neither confirmed nor denied but which one senior adviser winkingly described as “karma” on Wednesday, suggest that Kyiv is increasingly able to reach into Russian territory. \n\nEmpowered by NATO’s military aid, Ukrainian troops are hitting infrastructure, military targets and, Russian authorities say, at least some villages. \n\n",

    "PARIS — Surging energy prices are posing a growing problem for Europe’s economies, as new figures showed on Friday that inflation in the eurozone increased to 7.5 percent this month, the highest level on record, while economic growth weakened to 0.2 percent.\n\nRising inflation was a key concern in Europe even before the war in Ukraine, as its economies struggled to weather supply chain disruptions and the long-term impact of coronavirus restrictions. The more recent European sanctions against Russia and the rising tensions over fossil fuel imports have further amplified the concerns by sending energy prices spiraling upward.\n\nPressure is unlikely to fade. On Wednesday, Russia’s state-controlled gas company effectively shut off the supply of natural gas to Poland and Bulgaria and the Kremlin warned that other countries could face the same fate.\n\n",

    "- The United Nations resumed a “safe passage” operation Sunday to evacuate civilians from a steel plant in Mariupol that has been the last base for Ukrainian fighters and others in the besieged port city, according to a U.N. spokesman. About 100 civilians were being transferred to Ukrainian-controlled territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday.\n\n- Moscow’s recent actions in the Russian-occupied region of Kherson — where civilians are facing an Internet blackout and the implementation of a plan to use Russian currency — “are likely indicative of Russian intent to exert strong political and economic influence in Kherson over the long term,” according to a British intelligence update.\n\n- Europe is scrambling to respond to the energy crisis prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after Putin cut off natural gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland for refusing to pay in rubles.\n\n",

He spoke in their comfortable Riga two-story walk-up, standing near a high shelf with a white Santa Claus statue from his childhood — a reminder of what he had left behind.\n\n“The war made me realize that Russia will not change,” he said.\n\n",

Stepan Tarabalka, a pilot who died March 13 in an air battle with Russian forces.\n\nThe Ghost of Kyiv is one of the most successful pieces of propaganda promoting the prowess of the nation’s fighting forces and lifting morale. Although Ukrainian officials and former president Petro Poroshenko promoted the myth, the air force warned people to not “neglect the basic rules of information hygiene” and to “check the sources of information, before spreading it.”\n\n",

    "BRUSSELS — The European Commission has proposed a plan to phase out Russian oil imports, stepping up its efforts to cut off a key source of funding for the Kremlin.\n\nThe proposal, which must still be approved by member states, reflects extended negotiations over how far the European Union should go to penalize and isolate Russia for its war in Ukraine. The phaseout is more gradual than the immediate embargo some countries had been pushing for. It would ban oil imports after six months and refined petroleum products by the end of the year.\n\nBut an oil phaseout would still represent a dramatic shift for the E.U., which in March told the United States it couldn’t join a Russian energy embargo.\n\nThe oil plan is the centerpiece of E.U.'s sixth round of sanctions, a package that would also remove Russia’s biggest bank, Sberbank, and two others from the SWIFT payment system.\n\n",

The hope is to attract intelligence — and potentially gain more access to official Russian secrets — from disaffected people who have been trying to contact the CIA since the war began.\n\nTo ensure the would-be informants are not caught by Russian state security, the CIA spelled out detailed Russian-language instructions in three social media posts on how to use the Tor Internet browser, which lets users move online anonymously, as well as virtual private networks, or VPNs. \n\nThe steps will open a dedicated channel to the CIA that is more secure than navigating to the agency using an ordinary Web browser or Internet connection.\n\n",

    "IVANIVKA, Ukraine — Olena peered out from her bedroom window to see what looked like her neighbor, a tall man nicknamed Girovka, step out of a car with Russian markings and begin sending flares into the night sky from the side of the road. The next day, Russian tanks and armored vehicles emerged from the woods in a long column, descending on this small village about 60 miles south of the Russian border, along the same road.\n\nDays later, after the Russian retreat from northern and central Ukraine, four investigators from the Security Service of Ukraine filed into 66-year-old Olena’s living room. She told them what she’d seen and showed them the spot where Girovka had stood and fired the flares. Other neighbors told investigators Girovka had been seen walking to and from Ukrainian positions minutes before they were shelled by Russian forces.\n\nNo one in the village has seen the neighbor since.\n\n",

    "When Russian forces withdrew from the suburbs around Kyiv last month, the horrors they left behind — bodies lying in the streets, signs of summary killings and reports of torture and mass graves — shocked the Western world and led to calls for war crimes investigations.\n\nThen there were the accounts of rape and other sexual violence — at a factory in Bucha, in a basement in Irpin, at gunpoint in a village east of Kyiv.\n\nRape has long been used by the world’s armies as an instrument of war — to humiliate and terrorize populations or as part of campaigns of ethnic cleansing. It is also a crime under international law and, after decades of advocacy, has formed the basis of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity cases against perpetrators in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.\n\nBut, experts say, rape is an extremely difficult crime to document and even more challenging to prosecute — namely in times of war.\n\n",

The yacht, known as the Scheherazade, had been undergoing repairs since before the Russia-launched war in Ukraine. But earlier this week, it had returned to the water, according to a New York Times reporter who visited the marina, prompting fears the vessel might depart and evade sanctions.\n\nThe ship, until the measures imposed Friday evening, would have been free to leave.\n\n",

    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky outlined his conditions Friday for entering peace talks with Russia, demanding a restoration of preinvasion borders, the return of more than 5 million refugees, membership in the European Union and accountability from Russian military leaders before Kyiv would consider laying down its arms.\n\nZelensky’s slate of requirements, which he listed during an online forum organized by Chatham House, are in direct conflict with the military objectives Russian leaders have articulated as they bear down on the Donbas region and southern Ukraine — inflicting additional casualties Friday in apparent violation of a cease-fire.\n\nThey also come as Ukraine and its allies await possible pronouncements or dramatic shifts on the battlefield by Moscow before Monday, when Russia observes Victory Day, commemorating the surrender of Nazi Germany and the end of the European front in World War II.\n\n",

    "LVIV, Ukraine — Sure, it looks like a pile of dirt ringed by boxy gray shacks, but that’s not what Anton Kolomyeytsev sees at a construction site here in this western Ukrainian city.\n\nAs the city’s chief architect, he envisions a village of container-style housing for families displaced by Russia’s war in Ukraine. He sees playground equipment accessible for wounded children. Meals cooked by students from a nearby culinary institute. And enough greenery to make it “the best courtyard in the whole neighborhood.”\n\nThose plans will take months — and the first families are expected to move in next week.\n\n“We have to invent things out of nothing,” Kolomyeytsev said. “We know that those who came here want to live in Ukraine. They can go west, to Poland or other countries, but it’s their decision to stay in Ukraine, to develop Ukraine.”\n\n",

    "\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, speaking from Moscow’s Red Square at the start of a military pageant, defended his country’s military action in Ukraine as “necessary, timely and the only right solution.”\n\nPutin told 11,000 assembled service personnel gathered to mark Victory Day, a commemoration of the Soviet Union’s World War II win over the Nazis, that Russian forces entered Ukraine as “preemptive pushback” to what he claimed, without evidence, were Western plans to carry out attacks on eastern Ukraine. The United States and Western allies, while backing Ukraine and funneling weapons and aid, have not entered the fight.\n\nUkrainian officials had speculated Putin might use the event to formally acknowledge that the two countries were at war, but the speech did not contain major announcements. Cities across Russia are joining the commemoration.\n\n",

He cast Russia’s battles in Ukraine now as a comparable effort. “There is no place in the world for executioners, punishers and Nazis,” he said. A day earlier, he had described Ukrainians as “Nazi filth.”\n\nBut Putin’s speech was brief, made no mention of Russian troops’ poor performance and miscalculations. And he did not declare the “special military operation” to be a “war” or announce a general or partial mobilization to rebuild depleted Russian forces, as some had feared.\n\n",

Some 131 pieces of military equipment were displayed — fewer than last year’s 190. Russian authorities also eschewed the flyover that typically accompanies the parade, blaming the weather even though the sky above Moscow appeared only partly cloudy.\n\n",

    "\n\nLVIV, Ukraine — As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine grinds through its third month, gas shortages are spreading across the country, adding to people’s misery and testing their resilience in new ways.\n\nLines are forming at service stations in major cities, small villages and roadside stops along the highways that stretch over the countryside. Some stations have gone dark because they have no fuel to sell. With supplies tight and limits imposed on how much people can buy, motorists are relying on apps, gas cans and persistence to fill up.\n\nIrina Yusuchuk, 35, waited two hours in line to fill her Mercedes near her work in a suburb of Lviv. “It was really hard to find this gas station,” she said. “I’m just shocked.”\n\nThe shortages have spread in recent weeks as heavy fighting has shifted mostly to the east and life has started returning to something like normal in central and western Ukraine. \n\n",

Both Ukraine and Russia appear confident in achieving battlefield progress, making a diplomatic path unviable.

The women had been killed by a Russian land mine weeks earlier, the police said.\n\n",

Three dozen other countries have adopted similar export bans, which also apply to Belarus.\n\n",

One of Europe’s largest, it employed 10,702 people, including her husband. Now, for workers and their families, it was the shelter of last resort.\n\nA commercial complex, Azovstal was also ideal for war. A network of tunnels rested beneath an industrial site twice. Its deep nuclear shelters, complete with old maps and radiation containment plans, dated to the Cold War. The bunker quality of the place also made it a perfect fortress for Ukrainian fighters — a brave and ultimately besieged force that her husband, a new metal worker at the plant, would soon join.\n\n",

    "\nBERLIN — Russian feminist arts collective and punk rock band Pussy Riot took to the stage with an antiwar message Thursday, performing for the first time in three years after their lead singer escaped Russia by disguising herself as a food courier to evade police.\n\nSpeaking in Berlin at the start of a planned 19-show European tour to raise money for victims of the war in Ukraine, Maria Alyokhina, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, described her decision to leave Russia as “spontaneous.”\n\nIt came after Russian authorities announced she would have to serve a 21-day sentence in a penal colony. Alyokhina has been arrested six times over the past year on charges related to her political activism, with Putin expanding an already stifling crackdown on political dissent since his invasion of Ukraine. \n\n",

He is charged with violating “the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder,” for which he could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty, Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, said in a statement on Facebook on Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said Friday that the hearing in Kyiv’s Solomianskyi district court was a “preparatory meeting.” \n\n",

Three dozen other countries have adopted similar export bans, which also apply to Belarus.\n\n“Our approach was to deny Russia technology — technology that would cripple their ability to continue a military operation.

The money would also go toward ramping up production of U.S. weapon stocks to replenish the significant amount of weaponry already sent to Ukraine.\n\nThe ramp up in military spending, as well as a recent move to send more advanced equipment, indicates a recognition that the war may drag on, experts said.\n\n",

    "\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine spurred Finland to set aside long-standing concerns about provoking Russia and seek NATO membership, a major strategic setback for Russia.\n\nThe invasion also means there’s little Russia can do about it.\n\nThe Russian military is ensnared in heavy fighting in Ukraine, its ranks depleted by steep losses of men and equipment. Russia withdrew troops from the border with Finland to send them to Ukraine, leaving Moscow with a significantly reduced capacity to threaten Finland militarily.\n\nRussia supplies Finland with small quantities of gas and oil, but Finland was already preparing to sever those supplies in keeping with European Union decisions to reduce dependency on Russian energy. One possible early response came Saturday with an announcement by the Russian state-owned company RAO Nordic that it has halted electricity exports to Finland.\n\n",

They were known among real estate agents for always wanting armed guards. One mining and metals tycoon, Alisher Usmanov, would announce his presence every summer with the arrival of one of the world’s largest yachts, which he’d park in the turquoise bay, shuttling between the vessel and his villas, flying in guests on helicopters.\n\n“It was like having an oligarch state right here in Sardinia,” said Mauro Pili, a journalist who was once this island’s governor.\n\nThat state has now been dismantled.\n\n",

The Baltic states and Poland are asking for a significantly expanded military presence on their soil and new capabilities such as antiaircraft defense that could make it far harder for Russia to invade. Other policymakers, including from France and Italy, are voicing skepticism that the shambolic Russian invasion force will pose a threat to NATO territory anytime soon.\n\nAn initial decision must be made by the end of June, when NATO leaders will meet at a summit in Madrid.\n\n",

    "\nThe financial leaders of the “Group of 7” nations are expected to unveil a major new economic aid package as soon as Wednesday to help the Ukrainian government offset the costs of Russia’s invasion, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nGlobal officials have discussed providing as much as $15 billion in aid to the Ukrainians to cover financial damages caused by the war, though the final details of the measure are still being worked out, they said, speaking under condition of anonymity to discuss planning not yet made public.\n\nUkrainian officials estimate they currently face a monthly deficit of roughly $5 billion. The aid would be intended to cover the Ukrainian deficit for three months — amounting to short-term economic assistance, as world leaders have signaled a much bigger long-term recovery package may be necessary.\n\n",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his western allies are readying for a protracted battle in the east and south of the country lasting months or years to repel Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces.\n\nThe bill provides a combined $20.1 billion in military aid that is expected to provide for the transfer of advanced weapons systems, such as Patriot antiaircraft missiles and long-range artillery. \n\n",

He has criticized the West’s sanctions and defense spending.

Seven people were injured in the attack, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned as “absolutely evil.”\n\n- Russia on Friday claimed full control of the Azovstal steel plant in the Black Sea port city of Mariupol, and said more than 1,900 Ukrainian fighters from the facility have surrendered — though that figure drastically exceeds other estimates. \n\n- Finland’s gas transmission network operator said early Saturday that Russia had stopped shipping natural gas.

    "The Russian military, mired in a war with no end in sight, is attempting to resuscitate its sputtering offensive in Ukraine, firing commanders, splitting combat units into smaller formations, and redoubling its reliance on artillery and other long-range weapons.\n\nThe shift comes nearly three months after Russian and Western officials alike predicted a quick and decisive victory for Moscow. After the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers and an avalanche of failures since the invasion began Feb. 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin has narrowed his objectives in a campaign viewed as unsustainable, unrealistic — and likely unwinnable.\n\nThat assessment is shared by an array of observers, including Western intelligence officials and independent analysts. Mikk Marran, director general of the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service, says Russia is losing in Ukraine militarily, politically and morally.\n\n",

    "\n\n- The battle for Severodonetsk is becoming a focal point in the war as Russia seeks to capture one of the last major cities in a key eastern province still in Ukrainian control after its seizure of southeastern port city Mariupol. \n\n- Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is likely to dominate the agenda this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with Zelensky due to virtually address the gathering Monday. Ukrainian artists have turned a venue in the Swiss resort town that usually showcases Russian business leaders — formerly known as “Russia House” — into an exhibition of possible Russian war crimes. \n\n- The first war crimes trial to be conducted since the Feb. 24 invasion reconvenes Monday in Kyiv. The judge is likely to hand down a verdict after Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old Russian tank commander, last week pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed civilian in late February.\n\n",

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did not specify what variant Copenhagen had offered to send, but a 2013 guide to the missile system by manufacturer Boeing states that coastal defense systems use the land-based option.\n\n",

Other participating nations, he said, have donated artillery rounds and armored vehicles, or agreed to provide the Ukrainians with training and assistance to maintain its military systems.\n\nThe group is scheduled to meet again June 15, on the sidelines of a NATO meeting.\n\n",

They’ve reportedly also been used for carrying out sniper attacks. The bikes have a top speed of 55 miles per hour and are relatively silent — helping their riders evade Russian fire.\n\nUkrainian e-bike firm Eleek initially gave a few bikes to the military when the war began, according to manager Roman Kulchytskyi.

Glaring across the chamber at his Russian counterpart, Kyslytsya demanded the official, diplomat Vasily Nebenzya, phone his superiors in Moscow to appeal for an end to the offensive.\n\n“There is no purgatory for war criminals,” he told Nebenzya with a withering look replayed repeatedly around the world. “They go straight to hell, ambassador.”\n\nDiplomatic observers believe the failure of the United Nations, with its mandate to keep the global peace, to do more to halt the fighting in Ukraine is rooted in rules embedded at the body’s founding.\n\n",

    "KHARKIV, Ukraine – Yulia Yuliantseva’s journey home took longer than her flight to safety, yet each step was accompanied by many of the same fears.\n\nNearly three months ago, she and her 12-year-old son, Mattvii, fled their apartment in Kharkiv and ran through the snow to the nearest subway station — she in flip-flops, her son in stocking feet — as Russian forces pounded the city with rockets and heavy artillery.\n\nThough no part of the city was spared, Yuliantseva’s neighborhood of Saltivka, in the northeastern part of the city, was among the hardest hit. Thousands of her neighbors sheltered with her in the Studentska station.\n\nThis week, as Yuliantseva and her son packed to go after nearly three months in their makeshift bomb shelter, mixed emotions flooded over them. \n\n",

Christopher Cavoli, commander of all U.S. Army forces in Europe and Africa, told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that groups including the Islamic State, al-Shabab and Boko Haram stand to benefit from food shortages resulting from the war. Those groups, he said, “feed on weak governance and food insecurity and corruption and poverty.”\n\nUkraine is the world’s largest exporter of sunflower oil, the fourth largest exporter of corn, and the fifth largest exporter of wheat. Western officials have accused Moscow of using food as a form of blackmail. \n\n",

    "\nA Marine Corps veteran who volunteered to fight in Ukraine took cover behind walls as Russian gunfire punched through and felt the throttle of artillery so many times that his catchphrase, “It’s normal,” became a joke within the unit.\n\nWhat wasn’t normal, he said, was the feeling of dread while he hid and listened as Russian attack helicopters strafed the position his team had just fled. That moment “was quite honestly the most unsettled I had been the entire time,” he said.\n\nDakota, who is home in Ohio now after seven weeks of fighting, is among scores of volunteers who have taken up arms against Russia. Like others, he spoke on the condition that his full name not be disclosed, citing concerns for his safety and that of family and friends.\n\nIn interviews with The Post, foreign fighters from the U.S. and elsewhere described the disparities between what they expected the war to be like and what they experienced.\n\n",

    "For Ukrainians, the news from the front lines is not encouraging. As the 100th day since Russia launched its invasion nears, the tide of battle in Ukraine’s east seems to be pulling in Moscow’s favor.\n\nOn Monday, Russian troops entered the outskirts of Severodonetsk, one of the last strategically significant cities in the Luhansk region still in Ukrainian control. Should the city fall, it would give Russia and its proxy forces de facto authority over half of Donbas, the country’s eastern industrial heartland.\n\nIn an interview with a French radio station, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov indicated that the current momentum was part of the Kremlin’s newly focused aim. \n\n“Our obvious objective is, of course, to push the Ukrainian army and the Ukrainian battalions out of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions,” he said, amid rising fears among Western officials that Russia intends to annex territory in Donbas and Kherson.\n\n",

She spoke with Russian soldiers and relayed their instructions.\n\nRegional government officials now say Antonova’s intercession had a darker side. The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office, in a statement it posted online earlier this month, said Antonova and another regional official are suspected of committing treason.\n\n",

If Russia holds on to that territory, it’ll be well placed for future attacks.\n\n- Russia’s European neighbors are stepping up their response to the war.

Adam Bisultanov, commander of a military unit from southern Russia, according to state news agency RIA. The National Guard said Bisultanov had been killed in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas, where an armored vehicle he was in was struck by “mercenaries” from Britain and the United States.\n\nBritain’s Daily Telegraph newspaper reported in May that Grant — son of Helen Grant, a Conservative lawmaker representing an area southeast of London — was part of a group of foreign fighters that fired a rocket at a Russian vehicle. \n\n",

This time, Zelensky’s video serves as a reminder that Russia’s early objectives have failed and that, even with Russia occupying as much as a third of the country, Ukrainians will continue to fight.\n\n",

Although the commanders have acknowledged that far-right soldiers might be among their ranks, they said they are outnumbered by a more diverse group dedicated to defending Ukraine.\n\nThe Kraken unit operates somewhat in a gray zone — a force that answers to the Defense Ministry but is not part of Ukraine’s armed forces.

Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said Monday that the situation in the city had “worsened for us” and that Russian shelling had intensified. \n\n- President Zelensky visited troops on the front lines in eastern Ukraine on Sunday, including in Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk, where officials accused Russia of shelling a humanitarian aid facility.\n\n",

    "RIGA, Latvia — For Russia’s urban middle class, the war on Ukraine has messed up plans, ruined longed-for vacations and stripped away joys like shopping for a favorite foreign clothing brand, turning the key in a new Japanese car, even biting into a Big Mac.\n\nAs the war drags on, many yearn for life to go back to normal, before prices went crazy and foreign companies quit the country over Russia’s invasion. But these Russians are equally sure that President Vladimir Putin will keep on fighting until he wins, because that’s what he always does.\n\nAfter convincing the majority of the population that the war was necessary to “liberate” Ukrainians from “Nazis,” state television propagandists are now doggedly preparing Russians for a long war, ominously warning that it might end in nuclear war.\n\n",

Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The transfer of additional rocket artillery to Ukraine from existing U.S. Army or U.S. Marine Corps stocks also would require explicit approval from the Biden administration.\n\n“We’ve got to start this thing with a program that is rational and deliberate and gets them trained to a standard where they become effective,” Milley said, speaking to reporters as he returned to Washington from France. “It will do no good to just throw this weapon system into the battle.\"\n\n",

    "Russian forces advanced toward the town of Slovyansk in eastern Ukraine on Thursday, pummeling Ukrainian troops with artillery as Russian President Vladimir Putin announced it was his “destiny” to gain control of territory — comparing his quest to that of Russia’s first emperor, Peter I.\n\nPro-Kremlin media reported that Russian forces were beginning a new stage of their assault on the east, with plans to soon take over Slovyansk and the nearby town of Kramatorsk. The Ukrainian military said in a statement that Russian forces are focusing the fight on Slovyansk, targeting villages on its outskirts even as Ukrainian forces fight to hold onto their territory.\n\nThe boom of artillery could be heard in both towns, and fierce street fighting continued in the nearby strategic city of Severodonetsk. Some 10,000 civilians remain stuck in that city, Mayor Oleksandr Stryuk said in a televised interview.\n\n",

Putin, whose hometown of St. Petersburg bears the czar’s name, praised Peter’s empire building and suggested that land taken by the czar rightfully belonged to Russia.\n\nPeter dramatically expanded the contours of his rule, turning Russia into an empire and declaring himself an emperor. At the turn of the 18th century, he launched the Great Northern War, a two-decade-plus conflict with the Swedish Empire that ended in Russia’s takeover of a swath of the Baltics.\n\n",

There are whispers of a coming referendum that would formally make Kherson part of Russia, at least in the Kremlin’s eyes. The armed occupying forces patrol the streets, while the blasts of artillery shells crashing in the distance can be heard daily — signs of the ongoing fight between the Russian and Ukrainian militaries for control of the area.\n\nInterviews by The Washington Post with people who live in Kherson, evacuated recently or are in regular contact with residents there painted a grim picture of prolonged life under occupation, in an area that marked Russia’s first major land grab of this war. \n\n",

Over the next two months, Kaminski and volunteers he recruited designed and refined eight versions of a tourniquet — pieces of cloth connected by buckles and plastic fastening clips — until they made one that was durable enough for war. It was easy for a soldier to tie and could be printed with consistently high quality.\n\nNow, they’ve uploaded their best design to the internet. Around 120 individuals and companies worldwide with 3D printers have accessed the design. Together, they have made roughly 5,000 reusable tourniquets that are bound for Ukraine.\n\n",

    "RIGA, Latvia — Russia is scrambling to recruit men to fight in Ukraine after major losses in the early months of the war left the army stretched thin and some soldiers disenchanted.\n\nThe Kremlin has so far declined to order a general mobilization of draft-age soldiers, because this could signal that the war is not proceeding as well as depicted in the Russian media and threaten to stir grass-roots resistance to the military campaign.\n\nInstead, the military has embarked on a campaign to expand the ranks of active soldiers who have voluntarily signed contracts by cold-calling eligible men and trying to reactivate reservists.\n\n“These efforts represent a form of shadow mobilization. These are piecemeal efforts that allow the Russian military to sustain itself in the war, but do not address the fundamental deficit in manpower,” wrote Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at CNA, a think tank in Virginia.\n\n",

Ukraine has pressed for E.U. membership, which is seen by some European leaders as a somewhat lofty goal and one that cannot be realized in the near term.\n\n- President Biden on Wednesday responded to calls from Ukraine for more weapons as he announced another $1 billion in security assistance to the country, which is struggling to hold back intense attacks. The package includes artillery, rocket systems, coastal defense weapons and ammunition. \n\n",

You’re my hero.”\n\nStiller, the “Zoolander” star and goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency, also met with U.S. ambassador Bridget A. Brink in Lviv and visited the cities of Irpin and Makarov near Kyiv.\n\nStiller marveled to fellow actor Zelensky, who played Ukraine’s president on television before becoming the country’s real-life leader, about “the way that you’ve rallied the country — the world.”\n\n",

    "European Union leaders on Thursday agreed to make Ukraine a candidate for membership in the bloc, a symbolic win for Kyiv amid the war with Russia and another sign of how the conflict is reshaping the world.\n\nHeads of state and government, meeting in Brussels for a two-day European Council, also agreed to candidacy for Moldova. Leaders said Georgia will become a candidate after meeting conditions.\n\nThe decision is a historic step for Europe — and sends a signal to Russia. “Today is a good day for Europe,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted. “This decision strengthens us all. It strengthens Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, in the face of Russian imperialism. And it strengthens the EU.”\n\n",

    "KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine is running out of shells for the majority of its artillery in part because of a clandestine Russian campaign of bullying and sabotage over the past eight years, including bombings of key munitions depots across Eastern Europe that officials have linked to Moscow, according to Ukrainian government officials and military analysts.\n\nFighting in eastern and southern Ukraine is now almost exclusively a near-constant exchange of artillery, and Ukraine’s shortage of shells has exacerbated what was already a mismatch on the battlefield against a Russian military with more weapons. Russia is firing more than 60,000 shells per day — 10 times more than the Ukrainians, Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar told the Post. \n\nMost of Ukraine’s artillery pieces date back to the Soviet Union, meaning they rely on the same 122mm- and 152mm-caliber rounds that Russia uses.\n\n",

And views on Russia dropped from one-third of Poles sharing a favorable view in 2019 to a measly 2 percent in 2022.\n\nOverall, Russia saw a steep decline in its favorability since 2020. All 18 countries surveyed recorded all-time low shares in positive opinions of the nation — even as Russia was already seen in a relatively unfavorable light.\n\nA median of 85 percent across nations saw Russia unfavorably this year.

Ukraine faces a monthly budget deficit of $5 billion and has sustained more than $100 billion in direct damage to its civilian infrastructure alone, according to analysts at the Kyiv School of Economics. The World Bank previously estimated that Ukraine’s economy could contract by as much as 45 percent this year.\n\n",
