    "The low rumble of heavy artillery fire echoed across Kyiv on Friday as Russian forces renewed their ground offensive and widened their bombardment of Ukraine.\n\nIn other major developments:\n\n— President Biden said the United States would join the European Union and other allies in stripping Russia of normal trade relations to punish and isolate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for his invasion of Ukraine. Biden also said he would ban imports of some Russian goods, including seafood, vodka and nonindustrial diamonds. “Putin must pay the price,” he said.\n\n— The United Nations said on Friday that at least 564 civilians had been killed and another 982 people had been injured by Russian forces so far in the war in Ukraine, but acknowledged that the full casualty toll was most likely much higher. In Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said, the death toll has reached 1,552 since the beginning of Russia’s siege and bombing of the city.\n\n— Russia on Friday began the process of declaring Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, an “extremist organization” and started blocking access to Instagram. \n\n",

Ukrainian officials said that Russian planes fired about 30 missiles, 22 of which were intercepted by Ukraine’s air defenses.\n\nThe base, known as the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, was a training ground for up to 1,000 foreign fighters that Ukraine plans to use to help fight Russia, a Ukrainian military official said.\n\nUkrainian officials called Russia’s strike, which also wounded at least 134 people, a “terrorist attack,” and they renewed calls for NATO to establish a no-fly zone.\n\n",

    "\n\n— Russian and Ukrainian negotiators resumed talks on Monday, holding a virtual meeting as Ukrainian officials hinted at progress in negotiations. A priority of the meeting was efforts to provide assistance and facilitate the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of civilians from Mariupol and other cities facing Russian bombardment.\n— China dismissed U.S. allegations that Russia had asked it for military equipment and economic support. \n— Kyiv was hit by heavy artillery strikes on Monday morning, after days of heavy fighting in the suburbs. One projectile struck an apartment building, blowing out windows and causing a fire. At least two people died, according to local authorities.\n— Fighting damaged a 16th-century monastery and cave complex that is a highly revered Orthodox Christian site for believers in both Russia and Ukraine."

    "\n\nIndia is in talks with Moscow about increasing oil imports from Russia in an effort to keep spiraling prices in check, India’s petroleum minister told Parliament this week. The move comes as New Delhi is also striving to preserve its relationship with Moscow, its biggest supplier of weapons, at a time when India faces an aggressive China on its borders.\n\n“I myself have had a conversation with the appropriate levels of the Russian federation,” Hardeep Singh Puri, India’s minister of gas and petroleum, told lawmakers on Monday. He said the issues being discussed included insurance, freight, and payment arrangements.\n\nIndia depends on imports for about 80 percent of its oil needs, with 3 percent of that coming from Russia. India’s oil and petroleum imports from Russia amount to nearly $1 billion, Alexander Novak, Russia’s deputy prime minister, said in a statement on Friday.\n\nReuters reported earlier that Indian officials were in talks with Russia to import crude oil at a discounted price and that one of India’s main refineries had bought millions of barrels from the trader Vitol to be delivered in May.\n\nMr. Novak, after a call with Mr. Puri, said that Moscow was “interested in further attracting Indian investment to the Russian oil and gas sector and expanding Russian companies’ sales networks in India.”\n\nAs much of the world has shunned Russia and tightened economic sanctions against it since its invasion of Ukraine, India has played a tricky balancing act, simultaneously working with Ukraine and its Western allies while stopping short of voting against Russia in international forums.\n\nIndia has not supported the penalties. But prospects of the United States’ fury if it deals with Russian entities under sanctions nevertheless hang over the trade between New Delhi and Moscow. The relatively small size of their trade — about $9 billion a year, less than one-tenth of Russia’s trade with its largest trading partner, China — is such that even if India helped Russia evade some of the sanctions, it would not amount to sizable relief to Moscow.\n\nOn oil, Indian officials seem to be navigating an evolving gray area and drawing on past experience of arrangements with Moscow where trade continued in local currencies. While the United States has banned Russian oil imports, the European Union has stopped short — issuing sanctions against specific companies without banning the purchase of Russian oil."

    "President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is scheduled to speak via video to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, in another high-stakes appeal for help a day after a dramatic meeting with three European leaders in Kyiv as fires blazed in the wreckage from Russia’s relentless bombardment.\n\nMr. Zelensky is expected to amplify his pleas for more military aid and to increase the pressure on the United States and its allies, which have so far been reluctant to agree to Ukraine’s request for Polish MIG fighter planes.\n\nPresident Biden is planning to announce $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday shortly after Mr. Zelensky’s speech, according to White House officials. His administration has already pledged aid in the hundreds of millions, but Mr. Zelensky says Ukraine needs far more.\n\nUkrainian officials plan to present the United States with a list of military equipment they need, including armed drones and mobile air-defense systems, as Mr. Zelensky addresses Congress, according to two European diplomats briefed on the request. Beyond the MIG fighter planes, Ukrainian officials have crafted a list of additional matériel the Biden administration might be more willing to give, one of the diplomats said.\n\nMr. Zelensky has tried to rally international support as Ukraine faces a devastating barrage from Russian forces, largely on its own.\n\n“This is their attempt to annihilate the Ukrainian people,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video address to the Canadian Parliament, repeating his plea for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. “It is an attempt to destroy our future, our nation, our character.”\n\nHere’s a look at other developments:\n\nThe risky visit by the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia unfolded in tight secrecy as they crossed the Ukrainian border by train after dawn. In a statement after the meeting, Mr. Zelensky said the trio “fear nothing,” adding, “I am sure that with such friends, with such countries, with such neighbors and partners, we will really be able to win.”\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia disparaged the second consecutive day of negotiations with Ukraine, undercutting the faint glimmers of hope raised from talks the day before that both sides were looking for a way to halt the war.\n\nMr. Biden announced his own plans to travel to Europe next week to showcase the unity of the NATO alliance in the face of Russian aggression."

Air raid sirens also sounded throughout the night.\n\nShortly after 6 a.m., rescuers received a report of a partly collapsed residential building in the city’s Shevchenkivskyi district, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said on Facebook, and began evacuating people from the building. Two were injured, and at least 37 people were evacuated.\n\nThe area of the city is home to a cluster of universities, and before the invasion was known for lively student bars and restaurants."

    "The war in Ukraine entered its fourth week on Thursday with no clear signs of a peaceful resolution, hours after President Volodymyr Zelensky made a desperate appeal to the United States and Europe for more aid to help his military fend off invading Russian forces.\n\nThe United States announced another $800 million in aid, in addition to the $13.6 billion that had already been approved, after Mr. Zelensky spoke to Congress on Wednesday as part of his virtual tour to seek moral and financial support from allies. But President Biden stopped short of agreeing to provide what Mr. Zelensky says would be the most valuable tools for repel Russian forces: fighter planes and a no-fly zone over his country.\n\nPeace talks between Russia and Ukraine will enter a fourth day on Thursday. But President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has sent conflicting signals about his willingness to negotiate — offering optimism for the talks even as Russian forces increasingly target civilians.\n\nOn Thursday morning in Mariupol, a port city that has been under siege for weeks, the fate of hundreds of people inside a shelter was unclear after reports that Russia had bombed it throughout the night.\n\nThe humanitarian toll in Ukraine grows precipitously each day. More than two million people have already left the country as refugees and another two million are displaced inside it.\n\nAll the while, the United States and its allies are pushing Russia further into isolation, imposing sanctions that have pounded its financial system and choked off the flow of foreign currency, stoking fears of a sovereign debt default.\n\nHere’s the latest on the war:\n\nMore than 7,000 Russian soldiers have died since the start of the war, possibly crimping morale, according to American intelligence. That is greater than the number of American troops killed over 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nMr. Zelensky, in his nightly speech, asked world leaders to impose more sanctions on Russian leaders, to help put pressure on the government to end the war.\n\nMr. Biden called Mr. Putin a \"war criminal,\" escalating the clash of words between the two leaders. A top Russian official said the comment was \"unacceptable and unforgivable.\"\n\n",

    "\n\nAs a curfew in Kyiv, Ukraine, ended on Thursday and rescuers dug through the rubble of an attack on a theater in the southeastern city of Mariupol, Western intelligence assessments said that Russian forces were making minimal movement toward capturing additional Ukrainian cities, although they were broadening attacks on civilians.\n\nResidents of Kyiv described a relatively quiet end to a 35-hour curfew that ended on Thursday morning.\n\nIn Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces have held off Russian efforts to fully surround the city, though shelling has left much of it in ruins. And in Kherson, a Black Sea port where Ukrainian forces have been mounting a counteroffensive, the Ukrainian General Staff said on Wednesday that one of its airstrikes had destroyed at least seven Russian helicopters.\n\n",

    " \n\nPresident Biden warned President Xi Jinping of China on Friday of repercussions if Beijing decides to give Russia financial or military aid to support its war in Ukraine, White House officials said, but they did not specify what those consequences would be.\n\nMr. Biden laid out for Mr. Xi the punishments that the United States and its allies had imposed on Russia as a result of President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine last month, said a senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity about the nearly two-hour video call between the two leaders.\n\nThat punishment has mainly taken the form of sanctions that have devastated Russia’s economy, the 11th largest in the world. The implication was that the United States could impose similar sanctions on China, the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThe call came as Russia is seeking to capture Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and second-largest city, Kharkiv, and expand control of the southern coast. But Russian forces are reeling from high casualties — 7,000 or more soldiers killed, according to a conservative American intelligence estimate — and the discovery of critical gaps in its military prowess.\n\nU.S. officials have warned that Mr. Putin is seeking economic help, military hardware and field rations from China. American officials have leaked those findings, perhaps to both embarrass Mr. Putin and put China’s leadership on the spot.\n\nAt a press briefing, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said that after the call, the United States still had concerns about how China would react. “We will continue to watch until we see what actions they take or don’t,” she said.\n\nAsked about the U.S. supplying arms and financial aid to Ukraine while telling China not to supply any to Russia, Ms. Psaki said, “I would remind everybody that Russia is invading Ukraine, not the other way around.” She also said that the material going to Ukraine is purely defensive, adding, “None of the weapons we have sent can be used to launch an invasion of a country like Russia.”\n\nU.S. and European officials see China’s role as a critical one, and decisions by Mr. Xi could push the war in different directions — perhaps toward a cease-fire or more robust diplomatic talks by various parties to negotiate an end to Russia’s campaign, or toward renewed momentum for the Russian forces in their deadly offensive.\n\nMr. Xi, who has built a bond with Mr. Putin over years and has declined to condemn Russia’s actions in Ukraine, gave no indication that he would involve China in efforts for a diplomatic solution, according to an official Chinese readout of the call.\n\nThat summary emphasized the friction between China and the United States over Taiwan before addressing Ukraine. It said Mr. Xi pointed out that “the situation in Ukraine has developed to this point, which China does not want to see,” and reiterated his statements that China would provide humanitarian aid and that Russia and Ukraine should hold peace talks.\n\nThe United States and NATO should also talk with Russia to resolve the crisis, Mr. Xi said, and he used a phrase he and other Chinese officials have employed when blaming troubles on the United States: “Let he who tied the bell on the tiger take it off.”"

Mosul covers 70 square miles and had a wartime population of about 750,000 people.\n\n“There’s no talk of capitulation for Kyiv,” said Lt.

He will head to Brussels on Thursday and then to Warsaw to meet with Poland’s president on Friday.\n\nUkrainian officials said that an attack by a Russian tank on a home for seniors in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk region had killed 56 people on March 11. The incident was belatedly reported, the authorities said, because fighting had made access impossible.\n\nThe deputy commander of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, Andrei Paliy, died in combat in Mariupol, according to the governor of Sevastopol, the Crimean city where the fleet is based. Paliy is one of several high-ranking Russian officers who have been killed in action in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called for renewed peace talks with Russia, despite few signs of progress after four days of negotiations last week.\n\n",

It was so powerful that it blew debris hundreds of yards in every direction, shook buildings and flattened one part of the mall. It turned the parking lot into a sea of flames.\n\nRoughly eight hours after the strike, firefighters were still battling pockets of flames while soldiers and emergency crews searched the rubble for any survivors or casualties. By 8 a.m. local time, the rescuers had pulled out six bodies and covered them with plastic, and they held out little hope for finding survivors.

    "\n\nBesieged cities across Ukraine were bracing for intensifying Russian attacks as President Biden renewed his warning that Russia may be gearing up to use chemical or biological weapons. The president also conferred with European leaders on how to dial up pressure on Russia ahead of his visit to the continent this week.\n\nAn unfounded allegation by the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin, that the United States and Ukraine had weapons of mass destruction in the country was “a clear sign he’s considering using” them, Mr. Biden told CEOs at the Business Roundtable on Monday evening. “He’s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful about what’s to come.”\n\nFrustrated in its attempts to take control of Kyiv and other cities in a war that analysts say is grinding into a stalemate, Russia is resorting to long-range missiles and other weapons to bombard cities from afar. Rescue workers in Kyiv were sifting through the wreckage of one of the strongest such attacks, which destroyed a sprawling mall in the Ukrainian capital. City officials said that at least eight people had been killed at the mall, which housed a multiplex movie theater, a fitness club and fast-food restaurants like McDonald’s and KFC.\n\nThe bulk of Russian forces are still more than 15 miles from the center of Kyiv, which remains the primary objective of the Russian military, British defense officials said.\n\nMr. Biden confirmed that Russia had used a hypersonic missile in Ukraine, the first use of such a weapon in combat, which Moscow had previously said it used on an ammunition depot in western Ukraine.\n\nThe president called it “a consequential weapon” that is nearly impossible to stop, and said that its use was a sign that Russia’s military was running out of options in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance. “It’s the only thing they can get through with absolute certainty,” he said.\n\nIn other major developments:\n\nIn response to Mr. Biden’s labeling of Mr. Putin as a “murderous dictator” and a “pure thug,” Russia’s foreign ministry said Monday that the comments had put “Russian-American relations on the verge of breaking.”\n\nIn a video address shared online early Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine condemned Russian attacks on protesters in the city of Kherson in the south and strikes in the Zaporizhzhia region in the southeast, where four children were hospitalized.\n\nScant information was available from the strategically positioned city of Mariupol, just 40 miles from the Russian border and key to Russia’s efforts to complete a land bridge to Crimea. The city has been cut off from water, electricity and communications and has been nearly impossible to escape due to fierce fighting. A Ukrainian official accused Russian forces of firing on buses evacuating women and children from the city.\n\nUkraine’s foreign ministry said children had been forcibly relocated from the eastern Donbas region, the site of fighting for control over two separatist areas since 2014.

It said the “first stage of the operation” had been “mainly accomplished” and claimed that enemy combat power had been “significantly reduced.”\n\nAnalysts cautioned that the statement could be intended as misdirection while Russia regroups for a new offensive. But it is clear that fierce Ukrainian resistance has exacted a heavy toll on Russian troops and held back their attempts to capture major cities.\n\nUkrainian officials said on Friday that the Russian military had been “partially successful” in creating a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean peninsula, a key strategic aim. But its ground forces were digging into defensive positions around Kyiv and no longer trying to take it over, according to a U.S. defense official. Instead, the official said, Russia is shifting its focus to the eastern Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting since 2014.\n\nPresident Biden is scheduled to speak on Saturday from Poland, a key NATO ally, and meet with its president on the last day of his three-day visit to Europe.

    "\n\nTwo missile strikes hit targets on Saturday evening in Lviv, a western Ukrainian city about 50 miles from the Polish border.\n\nThe city’s mayor said Russian missiles launched from Sevastopol hit an oil and gas terminal belonging to the railway station and what officials described as a factory producing important military goods. No one was killed but five people were injured.  \n\n“I think with these strikes, the aggressor wants to say hello to President Biden who is in Poland, 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Lviv, mayor Andriy Sadoviy said at a news conference as an air raid siren sounded overhead. “The threat is very serious.”\n\nThe attack came as President Biden was in Warsaw wrapping up a visit to Europe intended to bolster unity over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Biden said the United States treated its duty to defend NATO allies as “a sacred obligation.” ",

Having suffered heavy losses, a large formation of Russian soldiers has fallen back to regroup in an area around the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nYet around the capital, Russian forces continued to shell towns and cities, including Bucha and Irpin, where they working to set up fortified positions, according to Ukrainian and Western officials.\n\nElsewhere, Ukraine’s military — which has prevented the Russians from encircling the eastern city of Kharkiv — claimed on Sunday that its soldiers had won back two villages on the outskirts of the city.\n\nBut Ukrainian military’s intelligence chief said that while President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia did not have the troops to “swallow” the country, he may try and divide it by consolidating territory in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“There is a reason to believe that he is considering the Korean scenario for Ukraine,” Brig. Gen. Kirill Budanov said in a statement to the Ukrainian press service. “In other words, he will try to impose a distribution line between the non-occupied and occupied regions of our country.”\n\nRussian forces have focused on combating Ukrainian counter offensives and holding gains in the east and south, where the city of Kherson — a critical stronghold bordering Crimea — is now bitterly contested. In other cities, the Russians have continued a brutal campaign aimed at forcing civilians to capitulate or flee.\n\nThose who have remained in the ruined landscapes of cities like Mariupol, Sumy and Chernihiv — collectively home to more than two million people before the war — are now confined to bomb shelters and basements with dwindling supplies of food and water.\n\nAlong the eastern front, which stretches more than 600 miles from Chernihiv in the north the Mariupol in the south, the fighting is as intense as the destruction is vast.\n\nRussian forces have now encircled Chernihiv, about 100 miles from Kyiv, according to the city’s mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko. Tens of thousands are now stranded, facing a fate similar to those struggling to survive in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine again ",

    "\n\nNovaya Gazeta, the Russian newspaper that helped define fearless journalism in the post-Soviet era and whose editor shared the Nobel Peace Prize last year, suspended publication on Monday, leaving Russia without any major media outlets critical of the Kremlin as it wages war in Ukraine.\n\nThe newspaper, led by Dmitri A. Muratov, the Nobel-winning editor, said it would cease publishing in print and online until the end of the fighting — or what it called, in keeping with Russia’s new wartime censorship law, “the special operation on the territory of Ukraine.” Earlier in the day, the paper received a second warning from Russia’s telecommunications regulator that threatened to shut it down or revoke its license, Mr. Muratov said.

     "href": "https://nyti.ms/3qLJmaz"
    },
    "A video shared online Sunday shows soldiers who are likely Ukrainian beating and shooting prisoners from the Russian military. The footage shows five of the prisoners tied up and lying on the ground — some held at gunpoint and some with bags over their heads.\n\nIn the footage, which runs for over five minutes, the five tied-up prisoners appear to have serious injuries, but it’s not clear how they were wounded. Later in the video, three other captives are shot in their legs without provocation and fall to the ground. One of them is then struck in his face with the end of a rifle. The Times is not publishing the video because of the graphic imagery it contains.\n\nA number of the captors, who kick and hit the prisoners throughout the video, are wearing blue armbands characteristic of the Ukrainian military. Both parties are mostly speaking Russian, with the captors speaking Russian in a Ukrainian accent. At one point in the video one captor is heard speaking Ukrainian.\n\nThe Times has not identified the source who originally posted the video. But based on the video’s perspective and dialogue, it appears to have been filmed by one of the captors.\n\nThe location of the video, first suggested by a Twitter user, has been independently verified by The Times. It was filmed on the eastern outskirts of Kharkiv, near the frontline of the conflict, in an area held by Ukrainian forces. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, is closer to Russia than any other large Ukrainian city and has been targeted by Russia with overwhelming and indiscriminate firepower that has reduced parts of the city to ruins.\n\nFollowing the circulation of the footage, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the head of Ukraine’s President’s Office, released a video where he said that “all prisoners are to be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention, whatever your personal emotional motives” — though he did not refer to the specific incident near Kharkiv.\n\nThe abuse of the prisoners could be a possible violation of the Geneva Conventions, a series of treaties, signed in the aftermath of World War II, which are considered the essence of the rules for modern armed conflict, including the humane treatment of prisoners of war. Ukraine’s government has previously faced criticism for distributing videos of Russian prisoners of war in its custody.\n\nIn the video, the captors spend most of their time interrogating the five prisoners about the locations of various military units in the area, and ask the prisoners personal details such as their ranks and hometowns. At one point, one of the captives appears to lose consciousness. In the background, a man is heard yelling that they are doing this because “you were [expletive] destroying Kharkiv” — in what appeared to be a reference to Russian forces’ actions demolishing the city.\n\nAs the questioning is underway as to whether any of the prisoners are officers in the Russian military, three other captives emerge from a van before a soldier wearing a blue arm band shoots them at close range in the leg with an assault rifle. Two have their hands already tied behind their backs, while the other does not appear to have threatened the soldiers in any way. ",

If Ukrainian soldiers can maintain control of Irpin, it would be strategically important to keeping their hold on Kyiv.\n\n“Our Irpin is liberated from Moscow’s evil,” Mayor Oleksandr Markushin of Irpin posted on Telegram on Monday. But the deputy police chief, Oleksandr Bogai, offered a more skeptical account in a telephone interview, noting that fighting continued even as most Russian troops appeared to have pulled back, and that the Russians continued to shell the town.

    "\n\nThe first signs of significant progress emerged as Russia and Ukraine held three hours of peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, but Russia appeared determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine and officials predicted that weeks of further negotiation were needed.\n\nRussia offered concessions that signaled a more realistic course for the war in Ukraine, saying it would scale back military activity around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv as a good will gesture. But the Russian advance in the north had already stalled and diplomats and analysts indicated Moscow seemed in no hurry to end the war.\n\nIn his nightly address on Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that negotiations with Russia had been “positive,” but that “these signals do not silence the explosion of Russian shells.”\n\n“The enemy is still in our territory,” Mr. Zelensky said. “The shelling of our cities continues. Mariupol is blocked. Missile and airstrikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts.”\n\nAfter three hours of negotiations in Istanbul on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said the country was ready to declare itself permanently neutral militarily — keeping it from joining NATO, which has been a key demand from the Russians.\n\nRussia’s de-escalation claims were met with skepticism and fears that Russian troops would instead work toward taking another part of Ukraine. The British Ministry of Defense said in an update on Tuesday that it was “highly likely” that Russia would refocus its combat power in the eastern region of Ukraine, in Donetsk and Luhansk. “It is almost certain that the Russian offensive has failed in its objective to encircle Kyiv,” the ministry said.\n\nThe Ukrainians indicated they were open to discussing territorial concessions if President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine were to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Russia has said it would only set a meeting between the two presidents once a draft peace agreement was ready.\n\nHere are other developments:\n\nPresident Zelensky is scheduled to address Australia’s Parliament on Thursday afternoon, the Australian government confirmed on Wednesday. Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia and opposition leader Anthony Albanese will give welcoming remarks before Mr. Zelensky makes his speech video conference. It follows his similar addresses to the U.S., Britain, Canada and others.\n\nThe head of the United Nations World Food Program warned the Security Council on Tuesday that the war in Ukraine was creating a catastrophe affecting local agriculture and global food and grain supplies “beyond anything we’ve seen since World War II.”\n\nLate on Tuesday evening, Mark Vande Hei was expected to enter a Russian spacecraft docked at the International Space Station ",

The continuing fighting suggested that Moscow was in no hurry to end the war, despite claiming that it would de-escalate after the talks on Tuesday in Istanbul.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that it was “regrouping” its forces around Kyiv, claiming that their aim had been to tie up and weaken Ukrainian troops in order to prevent them from joining the fighting in eastern Ukraine. “All these goals were achieved,” the ministry said, adding it would now focus on “the final stage of the operation to liberate” the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine.

    "\n\nRussia is running its military campaign against Ukraine out of Moscow, with no central war commander on the ground to call the shots, according to American officials who have studied the five-week-old war.\n\nThat centralized approach may go a long way to explain why the Russian war effort has struggled in the face of stiffer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, the officials said.\n\nThe lack of a unifying military leader in Ukraine has meant that Russian air, ground and sea units are not in sync. Their disjointed battlefield campaigns have been plagued by poor logistics, flagging morale and between 7,000 and 15,000 military deaths, senior U.S. officials and independent analysts say.\n\nIt has also contributed to the deaths of at least seven Russian generals as high-ranking officers are pushed to the front lines to untangle tactical problems that Western militaries would leave to more junior officers or senior enlisted personnel.

But E.U. nations remained divided over the drastic step, underscoring the bloc’s dependence on Russian energy.\n\nThe outrage in Washington and in some European capitals was met with accusations from the Kremlin that the West had fabricated evidence of atrocities. Mr. Zelensky, in a speech released late Sunday that was laced with condemnation and anguish, switched between Ukrainian and Russian, directly urged the Russian people not to look away from the atrocities their army was accused of.

    "\n\nThe Pentagon is training Ukrainian soldiers in the U.S. to use armed drones to attack Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.\n\nThe U.S. defense secretary disclosed the training for the first time in House testimony on Tuesday and Pentagon officials offered more details on Wednesday. \n\nThe Pentagon announced last month that it was sending 100 Switchblade drones to Ukraine as part of a $800 million military aid package to Ukraine. \n\nMilitary officials call the weapon the “kamikaze drone” because it can be flown directly at a tank or a group of troops and is destroyed when it hits the target and explodes.\n\nWhen Pentagon officials realized that about a dozen Ukrainian soldiers had arrived in the U.S. on an assignment that was scheduled before the February invasion, they decided to give the troops a quick course. By the time they arrive back home in the coming days, the Switchblades will be waiting for them.\n\n",

The resolution to suspend Russia needed a two-thirds majority of votes cast, with abstentions not counting as votes, and is seen as a barometer of the world’s abhorrence over the apparent atrocities in Ukraine.\n\nThe resolution received 93 votes in favor and 24 against, and 58 countries abstained. China had said before the vote that it would not support the measure, as did nations including Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Iran and South Africa. Their arguments included that the move could worsen the war, and that further investigation of reported atrocities was needed before the United Nations took action. ",

If Russia takes control of the city, troops fighting there could be redeployed to Donbas, which is now Russia’s central focus in the war.\n\nDespite being outnumbered, Ukrainian troops continue to hold some key areas of Mariupol.\n\nBut given recent Russian gains, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington research group, believe that Russian forces are likely to capture Mariupol in the coming week.

    "\n\nRussia has sent a series of warnings to the Biden administration, including a formal diplomatic protest this week, demanding that it halt shipment of advanced weapons to Ukraine that could strike into Russian territory, or risk unspecified “unpredictable consequences.”\n\nThe diplomatic note, called a démarche, was sent through normal channels, two administration officials said, and was not signed by President Vladimir V. Putin or other senior Russian officials. But it was an indicator, one administration official said, that the weapons sent by the United States so far were having an effect.\n\nIt also suggested that the Russians were concerned about the new tranche of more sophisticated offensive weaponry, part of an $800 million package that President Biden announced the day after the démarche was delivered by the Russian Embassy in Washington.\n\nAmerican officials said the tone of the note was consistent with a series of public Russian threats, including to target deliveries of weapons as they moved across Ukrainian territory.\n\nOfficials said the note did not prompt any special concern inside the White House. But it has touched off a broader discussion inside the Pentagon and intelligence agencies about whether the “unpredictable consequences” could include trying to target or sabotage some of the weapons shipments while they are still in NATO territory, before they are handed off to Ukrainians for the final leg of their journey into the hands of Ukrainian troops. The delivery of the protest note was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nThe weapons President Biden authorized this week for transfer to the Ukrainians include long-range artillery that is suited for what American officials believe will be a different style of battle in the open areas of the Donbas, where Russian forces appear to be massing for an attack in coming days.\n\nWhile Pentagon officials were insistent in the run-up to the war in February that the United States provide only defensive weaponry that would avoid escalation, the nature of Russia’s attacks, including direct attacks on civilians and nonmilitary targets, appears to have muted that debate.

    "\n\nSpartak Kyurdzhiev thought he knew what war was. At 16 years old, he has lived in the shadow of Ukraine’s fight against Russian-backed separatist fighters in the east for half his life, playing computer games or doing schoolwork against a backdrop of artillery attacks that periodically rocked his hometown, Avdiivka.\n\n“I’m not 5 anymore,” he said. “To run and hide somewhere doesn’t make any sense.”\n\nAs he spoke, a volley of rocket fire landed with such intensity nearby that it forced the teenager to take cover.\n\nAvdiivka is no longer simply a town on the front lines of the conflict with the separatists, absorbing the volleys of a simmering war. It is now an impediment to Moscow’s military goals as Russian forces press forward with a potentially decisive operation in the east. The town’s force of Ukrainian fighters, dug into an extensive trench system, will be difficult to dislodge without massive firepower. ",

On Wednesday, they found out that the now iconic stamps had sold out.\n\nThe postal service printed a run of one million stamps with the image of a Ukrainian special forces fighter raising his middle finger at a Russian warship. The image related to an incident early in the conflict, when a warship demanded the surrender of a small group of fighters guarding a rocky island in the Black Sea.\n\nThe day after the stamps were released for sale on April 12, Russia’s flagship in the Black Sea, the Moskva, was hit by Ukrainian missiles, according to Ukrainian and U.S. officials. The Russian government said an accidental fire caused ammunition explosions. Each side said the Moskva then sank. ",

But the outlines of the grinding fight are just beginning to take shape, as the two militaries square off along increasingly fortified front lines that stretch over 300 miles. The Kremlin has largely achieved one of its strategic goals, seizing a “land bridge” along the Azov Sea that links the eastern Donbas region, now the focus of the war, with Crimea, the peninsula President Vladimir V. Putin invaded and annexed in 2014.\n\nThe only significant pocket of resistance remaining is a sprawling steel mill complex in the ruined port city of Mariupol, where hundreds of civilians and the last Ukrainian fighters are holed up in underground bunkers, under heavy bombardment and issuing urgent pleas for help. \n\nMoscow scaled back its ambitions to focus on the east after failing to seize Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, along with other northern cities and being pushed back in its drive to the southern city of Odesa. Fighting is concentrated on a roughly 300-mile front in and west of Donbas. ",

Austin III, the U.S. secretary of defense, said that there would be a more detailed discussion about what Ukraine would need to prevail against Russia at a meeting in Germany on Tuesday. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree it cannot do the kind things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” he said.\n\nMr. Austin, who made his comments during a brief news conference on the Polish-Ukrainian border, was joined by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who said that Russia had failed in its goal of destroying the Ukrainian state. \n\n“Russia is failing,” he said. “Ukraine is succeeding.”\n\n",

This time, it was quite the opposite.\n\nIn fact, it was a tactical victory in the war against Russia. The Ukrainians flooded the village intentionally, along with a vast expanse of fields and bogs around it, creating a quagmire that thwarted a Russian tank assault on Kyiv and bought the army precious time to prepare defenses.\n\nThe residents of Demydiv paid the price in the rivers of floodwater that engulfed many of their homes. And they couldn’t be more pleased.\n\n“Everybody understands and nobody regrets it for a moment,” said Antonina Kostuchenko, a resident. “We saved Kyiv!\" ",

Children make plaintive requests. “We want to go home” a girl says. “We want to see the sunshine.”\n\nThese scenes are from videos shared online in recent days by the Azov regiment, a unit in the Ukrainian military, which says they were taken in the bunkers beneath the sprawling Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. The Times could not independently verify the exact location of the videos, but the interiors appear consistent with the design of the plant, and a former employee confirmed the images seemed to have been created there.\n\nThe plant has become the last refuge for thousands of trapped Ukrainian fighters and civilians.

If carried out by Ukraine, they represent acts of once nearly unimaginable audacity; one of them prompted the first air raid siren on Russian soil since World War II.\n\nRussia has accused Ukraine of carrying out the helicopter strike and military analysts have suggested that Ukrainian sabotage is very likely responsible for the other fires.

    "\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin met with his five closest allies on Monday. Only one of them spoke up to support him on Ukraine.\n\nIn a gilded hall at the Kremlin, Mr. Putin hosted a summit of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, which is Russia’s answer to NATO. The alliance of six post-Soviet states was celebrating the 30-year anniversary of its founding. But the meeting quickly turned into a demonstration of Mr. Putin’s isolation.\n\nPresident Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus — who has supported Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine but has not sent troops — criticized the other members of the alliance for insufficiently backing Russia and Belarus against Western sanctions.\n\n“If we are separate, we’ll just be crushed and torn apart,” Mr. Lukashenko said.\n\nThe leaders of the other four C.S.T.O. members — Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan — did not even mention Ukraine in their televised remarks.

She remembers the stories of 1949, when her mother, Kristi, then a baby, was deported to Siberia in a cattle car with her own mother and grandmother and lived in exile there until she was 10 — part of Moscow’s effort to wipe out Estonia’s elite.\n\nSo it is perhaps little wonder that Ms. Kallas, now Estonia’s prime minister, has become one of Europe’s toughest voices against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. She warns that Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014, wants to do the same in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\n“Peace can’t be the ultimate goal,” she said. “We had peace after the Second World War, but the atrocities for our people started or continued then.” ",

The discoveries have been grisly.\n\nYuri Emets, 56, returned last week to find his home in the once bucolic village of Vilkhivka had been hit by several shells, blasting away most of the top floor.

Others have their hands over their heads. \n\nThe videos, filmed on March 4 by a security camera and a witness in a nearby house and obtained by The New York Times, are the clearest evidence yet that the men were in the custody of Russian troops minutes before being executed.\n\n“Hostages are lying there, against the fence,” the person filming the video says. \n\nThe nine men are forced to the ground, including one wearing a bright blue hooded sweatshirt.\n\nThe video ends. But eight witnesses told The Times what happened next. Soldiers took the men behind a nearby office building that the Russians had taken over and turned into a makeshift base. There were gunshots. The captives didn’t return. ",

Gen. Serhiy Kisel, had been suspended for failure to capture the northeast city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest. Ukrainian forces have not only counterattacked but driven the invaders back toward the Russian border 40 miles away.\n\nThe British agency also said that the commander of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, Vice Adm. Igor Osipov, had likely been suspended following the April sinking of the fleet’s flagship, the Moskva. A Pentagon official went further and said the commander had been dismissed.\n\nRussia has said nothing about any military leadership changes. ",

Other potential casualties of such a ban would be things close to his heart: his populist campaign promises, and a financial gravy train for culture warriors in Europe and in the United States.\n\nBoth have been fueled by Hungary’s profits from Russian crude. Gorged with cash thanks to cheap supplies of Russian oil and gas, the Hungarian energy conglomerate MOL — one of the Central European nation’s biggest and most profitable companies — last month announced it would pay dividends of $652 million to its shareholders.\n\nA steady supply of Russian energy has become a central part of Mr. Orban’s economic and political model, said Andras Biro-Nagy, founder and director of Policy Solutions, a Budapest research group. “Russian oil and gas are absolutely vital to his whole scheme.” ",

    "\n\nWhen the soldiers of Russia’s 64th Motorized Rifle Brigade arrived in Bucha in mid-March, they brought a new level of death and terror to the city.\n\nOver the next 18 days, in just one corner of this Kyiv suburb where the brigade took control, 12 people were killed, including all of the inhabitants of six houses where the soldiers set up camp.\n\nOlha Havryliuk’s son and son-in-law, along with a stranger, were shot in the head in the yard of their house. The soldiers cooked in the neighbor’s garden, killing and plucking chickens and roasting them on a barbecue as the men's bodies lay across the alley.\n\nBy the time the troops pulled out, two brothers, Yuriy and Viktor Pavlenko, who lived at the end of the street, lay dead in a ditch by the railway line. Volodymyr Cherednychenko was found dead in a neighbor’s cellar. Another man, caught by the Russian soldiers as he ran along the train track, was also found shot dead. ",

The call was from an old friend who had just got hold of some privileged information: Kurkov, a longtime critic of Vladimir Putin, was on a list of “pro-Ukrainian activists” drawn up by the Kremlin, whose forces could seize the capital in a matter of days. \n\nHe needed to get out.\n\nAs it happened, Kurkov was working on a novel about an earlier Russian invasion, the so-called Soviet-Ukrainian war of 1917-21.\n\nDiverted from his historical fiction by history in the making, Kurkov has been on the move ever since. \n\nHe has dedicated himself to chronicling and contextualizing the war for foreign audiences. \n\n“I think everybody should do what he can do best for the country,” he said recently. “What I can do is write and tell things, and that is what I am doing.” ",

    "\n\nFresh from an election victory last month, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary has declared a “state of emergency” in the country, using the war in Ukraine as a pretext to further entrench his power.\n\nBefore the announcement on Tuesday, Mr. Orban, a right-wing populist with ties to Russia’s president, had cited the conflict in Ukraine as a justification for the expanded executive emergency powers, which allow him to bypass Hungary’s legislative process and rule by decree.\n\nThe emergency powers, he said, would enable him to respond swiftly to pressing challenges spurred by the war such as ensuring the safety of Hungarians and confronting economic hurdles. European Union sanctions against Russia had disrupted the Hungarian economy, he said, causing prices to rise and endangering the country’s energy supplies.\n\n“This war poses a constant threat to Hungary,” Mr. Orban said Tuesday on Facebook.

That setback shifted his focus to concentrate for fighting over control of the Donbas, which borders Russian territory and where Russian forces have been active since 2014.\n\nMr. Putin’s military campaign has intensified despite the collected array of Western sanctions on Moscow, a level of diplomatic support for the government in Kyiv that is almost without precedent, and promises from Washington and Europe of more substantial military aid.

But now it is confronting a more difficult question — how to bind vulnerable countries like Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia to Europe in a way that helps them and does not create a further security risk down the road.\n\nIt is a question that will hang over a summit of E.U. leaders starting Monday.\n\nDespite pressure to fast-track Ukraine, full membership for it or the other countries on Europe’s periphery in NATO or the E.U. is unlikely for many years.

An encirclement and siege have loomed as a risk for weeks. ",

Transformative shifts in fortune for either side have become rare in the war, which has settled into a slow-moving slog since Russia invaded in February.\n\nBut the offensive is taking place in a part of the country where the influx of heavier artillery supplied by the United States and its allies could make a difference in the coming months. In the meantime, Ukrainian commanders are trying to keep President Putin’s troops off balance in territory they seized early in the conflict. ",

Mr. Putin went further, comparing himself directly to Peter the Great.\n\nIt was a new, if carefully staged, glimpse into Mr. Putin’s sense of his own grandeur.\n\nMr. Putin on Thursday marked the 350th anniversary of Peter’s birth by visiting a new multimedia exhibit about the czar in Moscow. He then held a town-hall-style meeting with young Russian entrepreneurs and opened it by reflecting on Peter’s conquest of the Baltic coast during his 18th-century war with Sweden.\n\nMr. Putin described the land Peter conquered as rightfully Russian.\n\n“He was returning it and strengthening it,” Mr. Putin said, leaning back in his armchair. “Well, apparently, it has also fallen to us to return and to strengthen.” ",

    " on Monday.\n\nMr. Zelensky reiterated his conviction that Ukraine would emerge victorious, naming a string of Russian-occupied regions around the country, including the cities of Kherson, Melitopol and Mariupol, and pledging that Ukrainian forces would arrive to liberate them.\n\nFor the moment, however, Ukrainian forces are on the defensive in eastern Ukraine, trying desperately to defend against the main Russian thrust toward the last remaining urban center in the Luhansk region. \n\nThe last of three bridges connecting Sievierodonetsk with its twin city, Lysychansk, to the west is now destroyed, Serhiy Haidai, the region’s military governor, said on Tuesday.

    "\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin on Friday reprised his critique of the United States as a declining power that treats its allies as colonies, while declaring itself exceptional and “the messenger of the Lord on Earth.”\n\n“If they are exceptional, then that means that everyone else is second-class,” Mr. Putin said of the United States in an address that the Kremlin had billed as “extremely important” at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum — an annual business conference once known as “Russia’s Davos.”\n\nHis remarks were delayed by over an hour after the Kremlin cited “large-scale” distributed denial-of-service cyberattacks on the conference’s computer systems. The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the attacks had taken out of commission the database of conference participants, complicating the process of screening the guests entering the plenary session at which Mr. Putin was to speak.

Putin would be forced to abandon it.\n\nThat prospect now seems remote at best.\n\nChina and India, the world’s most populous countries, have swooped in to buy roughly the same volume of Russian oil that would have gone to the West. Oil prices are so high that Russia is making even more money now from sales than it did before the war began four months ago. And its once-flailing currency has surged in value against the dollar.\n\nRussian officials are smirking over what they are calling a spectacular failure to cow Mr. Putin.

    "\n\nEuropean leaders meeting in Brussels this week were eager to focus on granting Ukraine E.U. candidate status, but have also had to address a pressing problem linked to the war: Russia has slowly been turning off the gas tap.\n\nThe tapering of gas to Germany in recent days has forced the country, Europe’s economic engine, to escalate its energy emergency protocol and urge Germans to save power. The next step is rationing.\n\nE.U. leaders on Friday asked the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, to come up with policy proposals to collectively handle the possibility that Russia, using Europe’s enduring dependence on its gas supplies to inflict pain on Ukraine’s supporters, could further reduce the gas flow or even cut off countries completely.

    "\n\nFour months into Russia’s invasion, unprecedented Western economic retaliation and military aid to Ukraine have not curbed Vladimir Putin’s ability or apparent determination to wage war, leaving leaders of the world’s wealthiest democracies grasping for new ways to deter him.\n\nMeeting on Monday in the Bavarian Alps, President Biden and the other Group of 7 leaders were poised to embrace an aggressive but untried plan to manipulate the price of oil and restrict the revenue that underwrites Mr. Putin’s war machine.\n\nEven as they searched for different tactics to hinder Moscow, Russia launched a barrage of missiles deep into Ukraine, striking civilian targets including, Ukrainian officials said, a crowded shopping mall where at least 13 people were killed.

    "\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia still aims to take most of Ukraine, but a breakthrough in the country’s east to other major cities beyond the Donbas remains unlikely in the short term even as Moscow’s forces consolidate their gains, the top U.S. intelligence official said Wednesday.\n\nThe consensus in U.S. intelligence agencies is that the war in Ukraine is likely to go on for an extended period of time, Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, said in her first public update on intelligence assessments of the war in more than a month.\n\nRussia, she said, controls about 20 percent of Ukraine, with a conflict line that stretches for about 680 miles. Insurgent resistance by Ukrainians in Russian-occupied parts of the country is increasing, Ms. Haines said, making it less likely that Russia will make rapid gains or that a peaceful resolution can be reached.\n\n",
